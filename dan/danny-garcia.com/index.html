                    <p>My current role uniquely balances form and function. I’ve designed prototypes for executive review, built custom tooling for designers, and engineered web and native applications across various platforms. Most of my work has launched as interactive web experiences on <a href="https://apple.com/">apple.com</a>.</p>
                    <p>I’ve also spearheaded collaborative efforts with designers while leading large teams of talented developers.</p>

                    <p>Helped the front-end team to define the technical process and strategy for projects. I interviewed and evaluated candidates, assessed the team’s skills to distribute appropriate workloads and coordinated with other teams to establish cross-departmental continuity. I also did hands-on development for various projects and worked with project team members to successfully ship responsive, aesthetically-pleasing, engaging user experiences for the web.</p>
